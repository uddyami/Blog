This is a Jekyll project provided by Wheelhouse.io. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can get back to your course by going to [github.wheelhouse.io/events](http://github.wheelhouse.io/events). 

You can find this page in your `_pages` directory in your repo. Edit the `01_about.md` file in order to edit this page, or you can remove it altogether by deleting that file. To add new pages to your site, just add markdown files to the `_pages` directory. We add numbers in front of our page names so that they'll be ordered correctly in the navigation bar. 

You can learn all about this process in "Section 3: Creating Pages and Posts" of the Wheelhouse GitHub Pages course.
